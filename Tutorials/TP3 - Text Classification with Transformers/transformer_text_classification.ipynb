I also heard that at first it was seized by U.S. customs if it ever tried to enter this country, therefore being a fan of films considered \"controversial\" I really had to see this for myself.<br /><br />The plot is centered around a young Swedish drama student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular she wants to focus her attentions to making some sort of documentary on what the average Swede thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In between asking politicians and ordinary denizens of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, she has sex with her drama teacher, classmates, and married men.<br /><br />What kills me about I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is that 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even then it\\'s not shot like some cheaply made porno. While my countrymen mind find it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a major staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, arguably their answer to good old boy John Ford, had sex scenes in his films.<br /><br />I do commend the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes rather than just to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good film for anyone wanting to study the meat and potatoes (no pun intended) of Swedish cinema. But really, this film doesn\\'t have much of a plot.', 'label': 0}\n"

The `set_format()` method lets you change the output format of a Dataset (for example, to `\"pandas\"`), without altering the underlying storage format, which remains an Apache Arrow table and can be switched to a different format again later if needed."

    "In this dataset, the class distribution is strongly imbalanced: `joy` and `sadness` are very frequent, while `love` and `surprise` appear roughly 5–10 times less often. This kind of skew can be handled in several ways, but in this chapter we will keep the original, unbalanced class frequencies and train on them directly *(see Exercice 1)*.\n",

    "Transformer models have a maximum input sequence length, often called the **maximum context size**. For DistilBERT, this limit is 512 tokens, which corresponds to roughly a few paragraphs of text. In the next section, a **token** will be defined more precisely, but for now you can think of it roughly as a word. To approximate how long tweets are for each emotion, we can examine the distribution of word counts per tweet."

These token encodings are then transformed into token embeddings—dense vectors situated in a lower-dimensional space. The **embeddings** are passed through the encoder block layers, producing a hidden state for each input token.

    "The plot reveals several intuitive groupings in the emotion space. Negative emotions such as `sadness`, `anger`, and `fear` tend to cluster in nearby regions, with only subtle differences in their distributions. In contrast, `joy` and `love` are clearly separated from these negative clusters and occupy a similar, distinct area, while surprise appears dispersed across the space without a clear cluster. Some separation between emotions is therefore visible, but it is not guaranteed or perfect, since the model was never explicitly trained to distinguish emotion classes and instead acquired this structure only indirectly through its masked language modeling objective."

    "**Fine-tuning** a transformer end-to-end follows a different strategy from using it purely as a feature extractor. Instead of treating the hidden states as fixed features, they are updated during training along with the rest of the model. This in turn requires the classification head to be fully differentiable, which is why fine-tuning is typically done with a neural network classifier on top of the transformer backbone."
